# GA Project 1 - Movie Database and Games

My first Ruby project is a web application designed for adult use and split into two key themes. 

The first theme is a movie database and has been built for all users (no adult specific themes) to browse movies, find where they are avilable to watch and read and add reviews.

The second theme is around games that I have built in Ruby and wanted to showcase. One of the games has an adult theme and should not be used with caution.

## Models

The game models are all independent of each other and built simply to function individually as single games.

The movie database is built upon three models:
- Users
- Reviews
- Movies<br>

The models are linked (associated) together to allow users to log in and leave reviews on the movies of their choice.

I originally planned for a further model of favourites which would have been associated with users and movies on a many to many basis. Time constraints meant that this model was abandoned but you will still see the model, controller and some code in relation to this in my files.

## Tech

1. Ruby 
2. Ruby on Rails
3. Postgrsql
4. SCSS / CSS

## Deployment

I was happy with where I got to with my first Ruby project so I deployed via Heroku.<br>
I have decided to make some changes to my project to get some additional coding practice with Ruby so I have removed my project from Heroku.<br>
Unfortunately this means that you can't navigate through my app or play the games I created however you can still review my code.<br>
I will redeploy again soon once I have made some changes.

# GA Project 1 - Movie Database and Games

My first project is a web application built using Ruby and designed for adult use and split into two key themes. 

Theme 1 is a movie database and has been built for all users (no adult specific themes) to browse movies, find where they are avilable to watch and read and add reviews.

The second theme is around games that I have built in Ruby and wanted to showcase. One of the games has an adult theme and should not be used by children.

## Models

The game models are all independent of each other and built simply to function individually as single games.

The movie database is built upon three models:
- Users
- Reviews
- Movies<br>

The models are linked (associated) together to allow users to log in and leave reviews on the movies of their choice.

I originally planned for a further model of favourites which would have been associated with users and movies on a many to many basis. Time constraints meant that this model was abandoned but you will still the model, controller and some code in relation to this in my files.
